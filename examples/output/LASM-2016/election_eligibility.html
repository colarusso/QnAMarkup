A: Yes

Q(5): Are you currently in prison or have you ever been convicted of a felony?
A: Yes
	Q(5.1): Uh-oh, sorry to hear that, I hope things have turned around for you. While there is no federal law that automatically excludes people who have been convicted of a felony from voting, most states have laws regarding voting rights for people who have been convicted of a crime classified as a felony, convicted of certain types of felonies, or who are in jail. You will need to check with your state election board in order to determine whether your felony conviction will prevent you from voting, and whether you may be able to get your voting rights reinstated at any point.

Q(6): Have you registered in your local jurisdiction?
